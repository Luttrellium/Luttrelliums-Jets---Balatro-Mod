# Luttrelliums Jets - Balatro Mod
## WORK IN PROGRESS
A Baltro Mod that adds jet themed Jokers. Suggestions and feedback welcome.


TO DO:

- More Joker ideas...
- Card redesign (Borders + Joker name on Jokers)
- Fix the issue of creating multiple Diet Cola's simoultaniously with multiple 'Pepsi, Where's My Jet?' Jokers (and/or retriggers of them). Should be sequential, aligning with sounds.

Joker Ideas:

- F/A 18 E/F Super Hornet Joker (no idea what to do with it yet)
- F-16 Fighting Falcon
- A-10 Warthog Ground Attack (Similar to hiker? played cards get upgraded/enhanced/destroyed for some purpose)
- Valkyrie Bomber (idk... speeeeeeeeeeeeeeddddd)
