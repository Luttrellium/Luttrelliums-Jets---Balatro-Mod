# Luttrelliums Jets - Balatro Mod
## WORK IN PROGRESS
A Baltro Mod that adds Jet themed Jokers. Suggestions and Feedback Welcome.


TO DO:

- Pepsi Harrier as tribute to @bepisfever on discord. Homie fr saved my brain from frying while doing this. (DONE)
- More Joker ideas...
- Card redesign (Borders + Joker name on Jokers)
- Diet Cola spawn sound needs to be a little louder and Negative sound effect needs to be silenced (Done)


Joker Ideas:

- Aircraft Carrier Joker (each jet themed joker gives x1.5 mult or something)
- F/A 18 E/F Super Hornet Joker (no idea what to do with it yet)
- F-16 Fighting Falcon
- A-10 Warthog Ground Attack (Similar to hiker? played cards get upgraded/enhanced/destroyed for some purpose)
- Valkyrie Bomber (idk... speeeeeeeeeeeeeeddddd)
